# Picard-Tribute-Page-Test1
The purpose of this tribute page was to take the test from FreeCodeCamp and take it to another level. It doesn't look the best but honestly my goal was to learn new features and mess around with the code. Thus you'll see videos and multiple fonts used and specified for each paragraph. 
My goal in all of this is to force myself to be more and more confortable with responsive webdesign.
